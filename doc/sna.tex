\section{Introduction}

  The coronavirus has recently spread with shocking speed and has tragically affected the lives of people around the world. Its fatal consequences have demonstrated the devastating power of exponential diffusion in social networks. A leading research group of biologists analysing the contagion of Covid-19 have shown that the virus spreads supra-exponentially and that it resembles the diffusion of cultural and linguistic innovations such as internet memes.~\parencite{EandT2020} Does this confirm the popular perception that certain cultural and linguistic innovations \enquote{go viral}?

  \todo{state gist of the paper}

  Societies constantly evolve, new products and practices emerge and speakers continually invent and adopt new words which diffuse through social networks of communicative interaction. Influential models in sociolinguistics like the S-curve model~\parencite{Milroy1992} share fundamental features with economic models~\parencite{Rogers1962} of diffusion and show commonalities between the spread of cultural and linguistic innovations. These models assume that the diffusion of innovations across social networks follows universal trajectories and that rates of spread depend on sociolinguistic dynamics such as network density and the presence or absence of weak ties~\parencite{Granovetter1977}. Unlike research on biological and cultural diffusion processes, sociolinguistic research has only fairly recently been provided with data sources that are equally suitable for large-scale, data-based approaches that use social network analyses to study these phenomena empirically.

  Social media platforms like Twitter have changed the way we communicate and interact and how information spreads and they offer big amounts of data for empirical research. Sociological research has recently been concerned with pressing issues regarding the impact of online social networks for the spread of hate speech, fake news and the power of \enquote{influencers}, bots and institutions on public opinions and elections, which increasingly strain the social fabric. For (socio-)linguists, social media data provide huge amounts of authentic text along with information about speakers and their interactions which opens up new possibilities for the empirical study of language variation and change as well as the diffusion of linguistic innovations.

  \todo{advantages of going beyond frequency}

  The size of these data as well as their informal nature allow corpus studies on the use and spread of new words which are often propagated via social media channels. In contrast to modern web corpora, which share these features, the availability of metadata about speakers and their interactions has been particularly important for the advancement of sociolinguistic research. Recent sociolinguistic work on lexical innovation has, for example, used data from social media users to gain insights about general trajectories~\parencite{Nini2017} and geographical patterns~\parencite{Eisenstein2014,Grieve2017,Grieve2018} of diffusion and about factors that influence whether new words spread successfully~\parencite{Grieveforthcoming}.

  Social network analysis analyses interactional patterns between language users and allows to zoom in on the sociolinguistic dynamics of diffusion to see, for examples, whether the adoption of new words remains limited to closely connected sub-communities, whether they reach bigger parts of the speech community and whether certain individuals or groups influence this process. While the study of social networks has had a long research tradition in sociolinguistics and has shaped current models of diffusion (e.g. \cite{Milroy1985}), new data sources have only fairly made it feasible to conduct large-scale empirical analyses using this approach. Advances in data and methodology of this kind put computational sociolinguistics in an excellent position to tackle old research questions in new ways, to test long-standing theoretical models empirically and to explore new questions and insights about language and society.

  Social network analyses of social media data have been successfully employed in diverse fields, for example to study the spread of diseases~\parencite{Lu2018}, opinions~\parencite{West2014} and political attitudes~\parencite{Pew-Research-Center2019}. So far the application of similar approaches to the study of lexical innovation remains scarce, although recent work shows promising results in testing mathematical models for the diffusion of new words in social networks.~\parencite{Goel2016}

  \todo{ask some concrete questions: e.g. \enquote{Who uses the word \ol{ghosting}?}}

  This paper aims to investigate the spread of new words on the social media platform Twitter, using social network analysis to zoom in on the sociolinguistic dynamics of diffusion.

\section{Modeling the diffusion of lexical innovations}

  How do new words diffuse and become conventional lexical items in a language system?

  \subsection{Research perspectives}

    A substantial body of linguistic research has tackled this question from different \hw{perspectives}. \parencite[16]{Schmid2016}

    From a \hw{structural} perspective, main areas of interest include which word-formation processes are involved in forming new words, whether they are formally and semantically transparent, whether they show variation and change in the process of lexicalization and which status the resulting neologisms have in the language system (institutionalization). (e.g. \cite{Bauer1983,Lipka2005}

    \hw{Cognitive} perspectives focus on how individuals process and store lexical innovations. Speakers generally use new words when they experience a communicative need to talk about entities or practices that cannot be expressed by their language's inventory of conventional words yet. In order for neologisms to successfully diffuse, speakers need to successfully negotiate their meaning (co-semiosis) in discourse, others need to adopt the behaviour of using these words (co-adaption). Continued exposure and use of new words can then lead to the entrenchment of new words in the mental lexicon of speakers.~\parencite{Schmid2008}

    \hw{Sociolinguistic} perspectives transcend the level of the individual to study the diffusion of new words across speakers. The diffusion of lexical innovations is commonly seen as successful when the majority of the speech community has accepted a new word as a conventional lexical unit that can and is being used in communicative practice.

  \subsection{The S-curve model}

    \hw{S-curve models} of linguistic change~\parencite{Labov2007,Milroy1992,Nevalainen2015} assume universal sociolinguistic dynamics for the diffusion of linguistic innovations.

    \begin{easylist}[itemize]

      # The \hw{trajectory} of spread is expected to follow an S-curve shape, with low rates of diffusion in early stages, followed by a period of accelerating spread with a tipping point at the mid point in the diffusion curve after which diffusion slows down and the curve flattens towards the end of the diffusion process.

      # These temporal trajectories are assumed to correspond to the \hw{sociolinguistic dynamics} of which individuals and groups interact with each other and adopt the target innovation.

        ## In the \hw{first stage} of slow diffusion only a small number of early adopters take up the innovative words. The individuals who use the new word typically form dense networks connected by strong ties. The structure of tight-knit communities of potentially like-minded individuals of similar backgrounds facilitates the successful negotiation of meaning (co-semiosis) of new words. High rates of interactions in these communities leads to high rates of exposure for individuals, which fosters co-adaption, entrenchment and usualization of new words in these communities.

        ## In cases of successful diffusion the initial stages are followed by an \hw{acceleration in spread} when new words increasingly reach speakers outside these tight-knit communities via weak ties~\parencite{Granovetter1977}. Rates of diffusion increase substantially when speakers that are not part of the initial group of early adopters start to accomodate the new words, allowing the innovations to reach a broader spectrum of the speech community.

        ## In \hw{later stages}, rates of diffusion slow down again as the majority of the speech community has already adopted the new words while smaller pockets speakers remain reluctant to take up the new words.

      # S-curve models have mainly been applied to the \hw{linguistic domains} of phonology and syntax. Fundamental differences between lexemes and linguistic items on other levels such as phonemes and grammatical constructions might affect the validity and reliability of such models for \emph{lexical} innovation.

        ## For example, grammatical constructions such as the \ol{going to} future used to express a speaker's future intention serve to fulfill relatively abstract communicative needs that remain stable over time. By contrast, on the lexical level, linguistic innovations are typically tied to concrete cultural referents such as products and practices whose conceptual relevance is much more volatile over time. For example, many lexical innovations such as \ol{millennium bug} denoting the fear of a computer crash at the beginning of the new millennium can show high rates of diffusion and become entrenched and conventional among the majority of the speech community. Without continual conceptual relevance in public discourse, however, these words fail pass on to the next generation of speakers. S-curves are commonly assumed to be found when linguistic innovations compete for \hw{\enquote{semantic carrying capacity}}~\parencite{Nini2017}, however, in many if not most cases of \emph{lexical} innovation the conceptual carrying capacity is far from stable over time which represents a critical deviation from the traditional assumptions behind S-curves in language change.

        ## However, the generally strong theoretical and empirical basis of the S-curve model for language innovation and change, also from studies on the diffusion of cultural innovations~\parencite{Rogers1962}, and the precise formulation of the sociolinguistic dynamics underlying different phases of diffusion still make it an attractive \hw{blueprint} for the empirical study of the sociolinguistic diffusion of lexical innovations.

    \end{easylist}

  \subsection{Current framework: the EC-Model (Schmid 2020)}
    \nocite{Schmid2020}

    I adopt the EC-Model as it offers an approach integrating both structural, cognitive and sociolinguistic perspectives on the diffusion of lexical innovations.

    \hw{Entrenchment}: individuals, not (too) relevant for the present approach

    \hw{Conventionalization}:

      society, sociolinguistics $\rightarrow$ focus of this paper

      definition: \enquote{Conventionalization is the continual process of establishing and re-adapting regularities of communicative behaviour among the members of a speech community, which is achieved by repeated usage activities in usage events and subject to the exigencies of the entrenchment processes taking place in the minds of speakers.}~\parencite{Schmid2020}

    \hw{Usualization} \enquote{Usualization can therefore be defined as a process that establishes, sustains, and changes regularities of behaviour with regard to co-semiotic mappings between forms and meanings or functions and communicative goals and linguistic forms. It affects the semasiological, onomasiological, syntagmatic, cotextual, and contextual dimensions of conformity behind conventionality and is relative to communities.}~\parencite{Schmid2020}

    \hw{Diffusion} \enquote{Linking the three aspects of speakers, cotexts, and contexts, I define diffusion as a process that brings about a change in the number of speakers and communities who conform to a regularity of co-semiotic behaviour and a change in the types of cotexts and contexts in which they conform to it.}~\parencite{Schmid2020}

    strong emphasis on spread across users and communities

\section{Measuring the diffusion of lexical innovations}

  \subsection{Previous approaches}

    Empirical approaches studying the diffusion of lexical innovations have only recently become feasible with the advent of new data sources and computational methods.

    Earlier work had to rely on \hw{traditional linguistic corpora}. Due to the low-frequency nature of neologisms general linguistic corpora do not allow to study broad ranges of neologisms and thus pose limits to making broad and robust generalizations about the nature lexical innovation. Despite these limitations, case studies on selected neologisms~\parencite{Hohenhaus2006} and studies on specific domains of neology~\parencite{Elsen2004} managed to shed light on the spread of new words in more specific domains.

    The advent of \hw{web corpora} in the last two decades has provided researchers with bigger and less formal data to study lexical innovation.

      The sheer size of big corpora $\rightarrow$ bigger samples

      monitoring corpora~\parencite{Davies2013}: tracking dynamics of diffusion, closer to coining

      In particular, a range of tools enabled the creation of specialized corpora for the investigation of neologisms.~\parencite{Renouf2006,Kerremans2012,Lemnitzer,Gerard2017,Cartier2017}

      the nature of web corpus data is particularly suitable for investigating lexical innovations as
        language on the web is very creative,
        more informal sources, bigger spectrum of language use
        new words often first occur on the web
        and use on the web significantly influences whether these new formations catch on or not.

        creative, hotbed

    this is all

      social network information
        users
        community characteristics
        influencers

  \subsection{Going beyond frequency}

    The conventionality of linguistic units is commonly assessed by counting how often they are found to be used in linguistic corpora, with high frequencies of occurrence seen as indicators of high levels of conventionality. Diffusion as a process that drives increasing conventionalization is thus commonly assumed to be reflected by increases in the usage frequency of linguistic innovations. Previous research on lexical innovation has been largely limited to this approach and has evaluated the spread and the overall success of new words on the basis of the number of tokens found in linguistic corpora. This paper takes usage frequency as a baseline and uses social network analysis to go beyond frequency to discover sociolinguistic dynamics of diffusion and conventionality that have eluded previous frequency-based approaches.

    Frequency measures are widely used to study linguistic phenomena on all levels, from investigating phonological preferences between communities, to studying the increasing establishment of grammatical constructions like the \ol{going to}-future over time, to assessing the degree to which words are conventional lexical units of a language. Usage frequency is thus commonly used by a diverse set of linguistic sub-disciplines. From a structural perspective, for example, co-occurrence frequencies of multi-word units such as \ol{handsome man} are taken as an indicator for whether these are free combinations or more or less fixed collocations in a language system. Historical linguistics investigates phenomena like language change and grammaticalization, by analysing changes in usage frequency of certain constructions like the \ol{going to}-future over time. Cognitive and psycholinguistic research commonly relies on frequency measures to approximate the degree to which speakers are familiar with words that are presented as linguistic stimuli in experiments to control for effects on experimental results.

    The reliance on usage frequency as a measure for different phenomena in these diverse research contexts has faced substantial criticism. \cite{Stefanowitsch2017} provide an excellent overview of the theoretical assumptions and problems that underlie frequency-based approaches in corpus linguistics.

    \todo{freq. is particularly poorly suited in the case of lex. inn. as new words are (1) highly socially indexical and thus especially prone to be used only by certain sub-communities, (2) topical which makes freq. less reliable bc. it fails to capture \enquote{dormant} passive knowledge of the words}

    When assessing the suitability of usage frequency as a measure for the diffusion and conventionality of neologisms a set of assumptions underlying the frequency-based approach need to be disentangled. While these theoretical and methodological considerations generally apply to all corpus-linguistic work, the focus will be on the current issue of the paper.

    I adopt Schmid's EC-Model~\parencite{Schmid2020} as a framework for defining and delimitating the concepts of \enquote{conventionalization} and \enquote{diffusion}.

    \begin{quote}
      [\dots] I define diffusion as a process that brings about a change in the number of speakers and communities who conform to a regularity of co-semiotic behaviour and a change in the types of cotexts and contexts in which they conform to it.
    \end{quote}

    Aside from the sociolinguistic perspective on diffusion (\enquote{number of speakers and communities}), Schmid conceptualizes diffusion as a multi-dimensional process that also takes into account changes on the syntagmatic (\enquote{cotexts}) and pragmatic (\enquote{contexts}) level. This paper will focus on the sociolinguistic dimension of diffusion and will leave an integrative approach including all three perspectives for further research.

    Applying this definition to the context of lexical innovation thus implies that the successful diffusion of a new word is marked by it being known and used by an increasing \enquote{number of speakers and communities}. By contrast, in a strict sense, usage frequency counts of a lexeme in a corpus simply represent the total number of tokens produced by \emph{all} speakers who have \emph{contributed} to the \emph{target text corpus}. The discrepancy between the theoretical definition of diffusion adopted here and the exact information contained by frequency show that this operationalization relies on a number of assumptions that let it only approximate the construct to be measured.

    Firstly, usage frequency does not provide direct information as to how many \emph{individual speakers} have used a new word. Especially in the case of neology, there are certain new words that are disproportionally used and propagated by a relatively small, but more active and dedicated users of the new term. This leads to high overall frequency counts which falsely suggest that larger parts of the speech community have adopted the term.

    Secondly, usage frequency only captures active uses of a term and fails to include how many speakers have been passively exposed to neologisms. In the context of entrenchment, \textcite{Stefanowitsch2017} refer to this problem as the \enquote{corpus-as-input} and \enquote{corpus-as-output} hypothesis. The underlying assumption is that the output of the speakers who have contributed to a corpus can serve as an approximation for the potential linguistic input of a comparable speaker group. Frequency thus reflects the \enquote{usage intensity} of neologisms in the speech community which indicates the degree of entrenchment in individual speakers as well as an approximation of the conventionality of the neologisms in the speech community. In the case of lexical innovation this can be problematic as questionnaires studies on the use of neologisms~\parencite{Kerremans2015} show that many speakers report that they have come across target neologisms, but have not actively used them in discourse. Relying on frequency counts only can thus often lead to underestimating the degree of diffusion of neologisms.

    Thirdly, usage frequency fails to capture where new words diffuse across \enquote{communities of speakers}, as suggested by Schmid's definition. This is, of course, a consequence of the fact that frequency counts cannot provide direct information about the number of speakers involved in the diffusion of neologisms, as was pointed out in the first two points above. New words often stem and quickly spread within tight-knit communities of practice that share common attitudes or interests. Frequency measures alone cannot detect whether neologisms only show increasing usualization within these groups or whether they diffuse and become conventional in other parts of the speech community, which represents an essential feature of the sociolinguistic dimension of diffusion.
