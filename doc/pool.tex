\section{Diffusion patterns}

  overall degree of diffusion (synchronic): successful vs. unsuccessful: \mtrc{usage frequency}, \mtrc{degree centralization}
    no success
    limited
    advanced

  temporal dynamics of diffusion (diachronic)
    stability: stable vs. topical \mtrc{coefficient of variation}
    trend
    increasing: potential diffusion
    decreasing: potential centralization
    time window: speed and lifespan

\section{Selection of case study lexemes}

  criteria
    covering clusters of neologism candidates
    frequency counts comparable

  selection
    no diffusion: \ol{microflat}
    limited
    topical: \ol{poppygate}
    centralized: \ol{alt-left}
    decreasing: \ol{solopreneur}
    advanced diffusion:
    advanced: \ol{upcycling}
    increasing: \ol{hyperlocal}
